<h1>Data Structures and Algorithms Repository</h1>

<p>This repository contains materials used within the course "Data Structures and Algorithms." It includes exercises with code prepared by the instructor, which required analysis, modification, or addition of required implementations. Additionally, it also includes exercise number 5, which was completed        independently.</p>
